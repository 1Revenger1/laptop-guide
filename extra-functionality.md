# Extra Functionality

Your computer probably has special function keys, and/or a backlit keyboard that you might want to enable it in macOS. Sometimes those things just work and are managed outside of the operating system and other times it requires installing device specific kexts and hotpatches. This section won't walk you through doing all of that, as it's just too much information. Instead this section will be used to link to projects that offer specialized functionality.
